            EcoFuture Uganda is a non-profit organization dedicated to equipping Ugandan communities with information about the skills, knowledge, and tools they need to achieve sustainable living. Our mission is to address environmental challenges while empowering individuals with information on innovative solutions that promote energy efficiency, environmental conservation, and sustainable practices.

          <p>
            We focus on engaging low-income households, school-going children, science graduates, and trainees from vocational institutes. By providing them with information on practical knowledge and innovative tools, we strive to foster a culture of sustainability in Uganda's energy sector and beyond.
